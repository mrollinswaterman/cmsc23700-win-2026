        This will be the primary function for generating your halfedge data structure. As
        the name suggests, the central element of this data structure will be the Halfedge.
        Halfedges are related to each other through two operations `twin` and `next`.
        Halfedge.twin returns the halfedge the shares the same edge as the current Halfedge,
        but is oppositely oriented (e.g. if halfedge H points from vertex A to vertex B,
        then H.twin points from vertex B to vertex A). Halfedge.next returns the next
        halfedge within the same triangle in the same orientation (e.g. given triangle ABC,
        if halfedge H goes A->B, then H.next goes B -> C).

        With these properties alone, every halfedge can be associated with a specific face,
        vertex, and edge. Thus, in your implementation every halfedge H should be assigned a
        Face, Vertex, and Edge element as attributes. Likewise, every Face, Vertex, and Edge
        element should be assigned a halfedge H. Note that this relationship is not 1:1, so
        that there are multiple valid halfedges you can assign to each Face, Vertex, and
        Edge. The choice is not important. As long as the orientation of the elements are
        consistent across the mesh, then your implementation should work.

        Arguments:
        - n_vertices: how many vertices in the vertices array
        - indices: int array of shape (n_faces, 3); each row [i, j, k] is a triangular face
        made of vertices with indices i, j, k. The vertices' positions in space are not
        important for building a halfedge structure, only their connectivity.

        ======== VERY IMPORTANT =======
        In order for your implementation to pass our checks, you MUST allocate
        faces/halfedges in the following order, for each row (face array) in `indices` array:
            - If a face array contains vertex indices [i,j,k], then allocate halfedges/edges
              in the order (i,j), (j,k), (k, i)
            - If an edge has already been encountered, then set the new halfedge as the
              `twin` of the existing halfedge

        You should use self.halfedges.allocate() when creating a halfedge (and same for
        self.faces, self.vertices, self.edges);  it will create, keep track of, and return a
        new instance of the corresponding primitive with an assigned, incrementing index but
        all other fields left as None. This index is also its key in the corresponding
        ElemCollection (self.halfedges, self.faces, self.vertices, self.edges). You'll set
        its other properties (the face, vertex, edge, next, twin if a Halfedge, and a
        halfedge if a Face, Vertex, or Edge).
