I intend to create an animation of a gift "wrapping" itself. I dont want to get too ambitious, so my plan right now is to have a parameterized cube laid out flat on the ground with some kind of toy mesh in the center. Then, each side of the flat cube willl fold itself 90 degrees until the cut-out becomes a 3d cube. Finally, I'll try incorporate some kind of bow mesh falling from the ceiling on top of the cube. There is room to add camera movements and color changing if desired later on.
